Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. Handle three different cases:

If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:

'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:

'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'
If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:

'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'


function howOld(age,year){
  const currentYear=2021
  if(year>currentYear){
    return `You will be ${age+(year-currentYear)} in the year ${year}`
  }
  else if(year<(currentYear-age)){
    return `The year ${year} was ${(currentYear-age)-year} years before you were born`
  }
  else if(year>(currentYear-age)){
    return `You were ${year-(currentYear-age)} in the year ${year}`
  }
}
